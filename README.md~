# Docker-ngx_pagespeed

## Automated Builds

  Docker automated build for nginx with ngx_pagespeed module.

## Build the image locally

  Download necessary files:

`$ git clone https://github.com/yassine-khachlek/docker-ngx_pagespeed`

  Change working directory:

`$ cd docker-ngx_pagespeed`

  If you want to build the image with a different configuration, you can make changes in the Dockerfile and nginx.conf that fit your need, like changing the self-signed ssl certificate informations or change the default nginx paths, ...

  The given nginx.conf is the default configuration file modified to enable https. If you want to build the image with a different nginx configuration, just modify the file and refer to https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/configuration for the ngx_pagespeed module.

  Note that is possible to change the configuration when running a container by mounting a data volume to specific location.

`$ docker build -t ngx_pagespeed .`

## Run examples

Run a container and see the output redirected to the console:

`$ docker run --name=container_name ngx_pagespeed`

In this case the container will have his own ip address, and can get it using command line:

`docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' container_name`

Run a container, expose port 80,443 to localhost and see the output redirected to the console:

`$ docker run --name=container_name -p 80:80 -p 443:443 ngx_pagespeed`

Run as a daemon:

`$ docker run --name=container_name -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 ngx_pagespeed`

Run as a daemon with adding your local static website to run it inside the container

`$ docker run --name=container_name -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v path_to_local_web_folder:/etc/nginx/html ngx_pagespeed`

When a container is running as a daemon, you can check ouput using:

`$ docker logs container_name`

Full example of running a container as a daemon using local: website, nginx configuration file, and ssl certification:

`$ docker run --name=container_name -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v path_to_local_web_folder:/etc/nginx/html -v path_to_local_nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v path_to_local_cert.crt:/etc/nginx/cert.crt -v path_to_local_cert.key:/etc/nginx/cert.key ngx_pagespeed`
